simple bmi calculator 
A simple BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator is a tool used to estimate an individual's body fat based on their weight and height. BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight in kilograms by the square of their height in meters. The formula is:

BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m))^2

Once you input your weight and height into the calculator, it will compute your BMI and categorize it into different ranges, such as underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese, according to standard BMI categories established by health organizations. This information can be useful for assessing potential health risks associated with being underweight, overweight, or obese. However, it's important to note that BMI is a simple screening tool and does not directly measure body fat percentage or overall health.
